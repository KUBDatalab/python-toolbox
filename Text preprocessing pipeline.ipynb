       "'PREFACE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe event on which this fiction is founded has been supposed, by Dr.\\r\\nDarwin, and some of the physiological writers of Germany, as not of\\r\\nimpossible occurrence. I shall not be supposed as according the remotest\\r\\ndegree of serious faith to such an imagination; yet, in assuming it as\\r\\nthe basis of a work of fancy, I have not considered myself as merely\\r\\nweaving a series of supernatural terrors. The event on which the\\r\\ninterest of the story depends is exempt from the disadvantages of a mere\\r\\ntale of spectres or enchantment. It was recommended by the novelty of\\r\\nthe situations which it developes; and, however impossible as a physical\\r\\nfact, affords a point of view to the imagination for the delineating of\\r\\nhuman passions more comprehensive and commanding than any which the\\r\\nordinary relations of existing events can yield.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have thus endeavoured to preserve the truth of the elementary\\r\\nprinciples of human nature, while I have not scrupled to innovate\\r\\nupon their combinations. The _Iliad_, the tragic poetry of\\r\\nGreece,—Shakespeare, in the _Tempest_ and _Midsummer Night’s\\r\\nDream_,—and most especially Milton, in _Paradise Lost_, conform to this\\r\\nrule; and the most humble novelist, who seeks to confer or receive\\r\\namusement from his labours, may, without presumption, apply to prose\\r\\nfiction a licence, or rather a rule, from the adoption of which so many\\r\\nexquisite combinations of human feeling have resulted in the highest\\r\\nspecimens of poetry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe circumstance on which my story rests was suggested in casual\\r\\nconversation. It was commenced, partly as a source of amusement, and\\r\\npartly as an expedient for exercising any untried resources of mind.\\r\\nOther motives were mingled with these, as the work proceeded. I am by no\\r\\nmeans indifferent to the manner in which whatever moral tendencies exist\\r\\nin the sentiments or characters it contains shall affect the reader; yet\\r\\nmy chief concern in this respect has been limited to the avoiding of the\\r\\nenervating effects of the novels of the present day, and to the\\r\\nexhibitions of the amiableness of domestic affection, and the excellence\\r\\nof universal virtue. The opinions which naturally spring from the\\r\\ncharacter and situation of the hero are by no means to be conceived as\\r\\nexisting always in my own conviction; nor is any inference justly to be\\r\\ndrawn from the following pages as prejudicing any philosophical doctrine\\r\\nof whatever kind.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a subject also of additional interest to the author, that this\\r\\nstory was begun in the majestic region where the scene is principally\\r\\nlaid, and in society which cannot cease to be regretted. I passed the\\r\\nsummer of 1816 in the environs of Geneva. The season was cold and rainy,\\r\\nand in the evenings we crowded around a blazing wood fire, and\\r\\noccasionally amused ourselves with some German stories of ghosts, which\\r\\nhappened to fall into our hands. These tales excited in us a playful\\r\\ndesire of imitation. Two other friends (a tale from the pen of one of\\r\\nwhom wou'"
