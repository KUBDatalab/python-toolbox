# Welcome to the KUB Datalab Python-toolbox course site


This site is a collection of individual notebooks. It is not intended as a single course.

The concept is to provide an overview over some ofthe Python notebooks that can act as the foundation for made-to-measure courses.

Based on the individual and specific needs in a given situation, we will make a selection of relevant notebooks, and string them together to form a tailored course.

The site is under development and it is not a goal to be finished. We will continue to add new content.
